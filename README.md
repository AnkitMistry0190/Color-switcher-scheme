# JavaScript Background Color Switcher

## Overview
This project is a simple and interactive web page that allows users to change the background color of the page by clicking on different colored buttons.

## Features
- Four buttons each representing a different color: Grey, Green, Blue, and Yellow.
- Clicking on a button changes the background color of the page to the color represented by the button.

## How It Works
The JavaScript code uses the `querySelectorAll` method to select all elements with the class name "button". It then adds an event listener to each button that triggers a function when the button is clicked. This function changes the background color of the body to the color represented by the clicked button.

## Usage
Open the HTML file in a web browser. Click on any of the colored buttons to change the background color of the page.

## Code Structure
- The HTML file contains the structure of the web page, including the buttons for changing the color.
- The CSS file (style.css) contains the styles for the web page.
- The JavaScript file (script.js) contains the functionality for changing the background color.
